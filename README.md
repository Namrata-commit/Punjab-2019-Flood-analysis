# 2019 Punjab floods analysis using Earth Engine Python API and geemap


geemap, developed by Dr. Qiusheng Wu, is a Python package for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine, ipyleaflet, and ipywidgets. 
Since it is a wrapper around ipyleaflet and ipywidgets, it enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively 
within a Jupyter-based environment. 
The geemap package is very user friendly and well maintained. It is under rapid development, and therefore feature requests are encouraged.
